# Computer science project (PI) : Data anonymization

## Task

You are a Data Scientist in an industry that deals with private data. Suppose
you have transcripts from interactions people had with their Google Home product.
Your team wants to do some fancy machine learning to predict your users'
behaviour, e.g. what they are going to buy next. The problem is your data
comes from many countries, which don't have the same legislation regarding
private data, and this data comes from subsidiaries so your users did not agree
to pass their data on to the holding company. Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to anonymize all these texts to remove any personal data before
handing them out to the rest of the team.
